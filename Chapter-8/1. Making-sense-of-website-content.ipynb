      "Combined Passage: As the field of artificial intelligence advances rapidly, it has become increasingly crucial to make the most of large language models (LLMs) in an efficient and effective manner. However, there are many different ways in which LLMs can be used, which can be daunting for beginners. Basically, we can utilize pretrained LLMs for new tasks in two primary approaches: in-context learning and finetuning. This article will provide a brief overview of what in-context learning entails, followed by a discussion of the different methods available for finetuning LLMs and the steps to create a dataset for fine-tuning LLM for the task of Question Answering specifically. Large language models (LLMs) that are trained on a general text corpus have the ability to learn in-context. This means that it is not necessary to further train or fine-tune the pretrained LLMs to perform specific or new tasks that were not explicitly trained on. Instead, by providing a few examples of the target task via the input prompt, the LLM can directly learn the task, as shown in the example below. If we are using the model through an API, in-context learning can be particularly beneficial since we may not have direct access to the model. Prompting refers to a method of incorporating additional information into a model’s output generation process. This is typically done by adding a set of text tokens to the input text, either before or after the original text, in order to transform the task into a masked language modeling problem. This process of modifying the input text with a prefix or suffix text template is known as hard prompting. The purpose of hard prompting is to provide the model with more context and guidance for generating the desired output, whether it be for classification or generation tasks. \n"
