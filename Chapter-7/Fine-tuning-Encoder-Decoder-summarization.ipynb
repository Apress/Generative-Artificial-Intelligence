      "'>> Document: In Wales, councils are responsible for funding and overseeing schools.\n",
      "But in England, Mr Osborne's plan will mean local authorities will cease to have a role in providing education.\n",
      "Academies are directly funded by central government and head teachers have more freedom over admissions and to change the way the school works.\n",
      "It is a significant development in the continued divergence of schools systems on either side of Offa's Dyke.\n",
      "And although the Welsh Government will get extra cash to match the money for English schools to extend the school day, it can spend it on any devolved policy area.\n",
      "Ministers have no plans to follow suit.\n",
      "At the moment, governing bodies are responsible for setting school hours and they need ministerial permission to make significant changes.\n",
      "There are already more than 2,000 secondary academies in England and its extension to all state schools is unlikely to shake the Welsh Government's attachment to what they call a \"community, comprehensive model\" for schools.\n",
      "It rejects claims that freedom given to academies can help drive up standards, and it points to academy-free Scotland as the best performing school system in the UK.\n",
      "Education Minister Huw Lewis said there was \"very little evidence to suggest\" academies have a positive impact in driving up standards and Wales would not be following the model.\n",
      "\"The Tories have wasted hundreds of millions of pounds on academies and free schools and as the Chancellor finalises his budget plans to slash vital services even further, he is committing them to wasting even more on a failing endeavour.\n",
      "\"We have no plans to introduce the chaos and waste of academies and free schools here in Wales.\"\n",
      "None of the main parties in May's Assembly election - including the Welsh Conservatives - have said they want to introduce academies in Wales.\n",
      "Owen Hathway, NUT Cymru's policy officer, called the academy plans for England \"scandalous.\".\n",
      "\"There is no evidence that academies work, no evidence that they raise standards, no evidence that they offer better quality education and no evidence that they are what parents and communities want,\" he said.\n",
      "\"Certainly a commitment to comprehensive education is something we would want, and indeed expect, all parties to hold firm to in their manifestos for the forthcoming Welsh election.\"\n",
      "But the Welsh and English schools systems are still linked by a joint arrangement for teachers' pay and conditions.\n",
      "Academies are not tied to these pay scales so in effect Wednesday's announcement will take all English schools out of the system and raise questions about the viability of an England and Wales pay and conditions structure.\n",
      "There is already growing momentum for the devolution of teachers' pay and conditions.\n",
      "Originally sceptical, the Welsh Labour Government is now broadly in favour.\n",
      "Some teaching unions remain opposed because of concern that Welsh teachers would end up being paid less than those in England.\n",
      "Mr Hathway said teachers were concerned it could lead to regional pay.\n",
      "\"At the same time we do of course recognise that the issue of pay is already becoming a grey area due to the negative changes we see taking place in England,\" he said.\n",
      "But an even bigger difference between the schools landscape on either side of the border, appears to make separate arrangements for pay increasingly likely in future.'\n",

      "The Manchester College business student who travels to Openshaw from Cheetham Hill every day said her journeys are costing £100 per month.\n",
      "\"[It] is obviously an awful lot of money for someone like me, who doesn't have a part-time job.\n",
      "\"I can look ahead to the next year or so without the worry of how much money I am spending on my journey,\" she said.\n",
      "The deal was proposed by Mr Burnham in his manifesto for mayor in April.\n",
      "\"I promised to help our young people get on in life, and this is the first step in delivering on that,\" Mr Burnham said.\n",
      "Greater Manchester Travelcards Ltd, which represents all bus companies in the area, will extend its multi-operator 50% discounted 16-and-under ticket.\n",

      "City only needed a draw with Luton at Maine Road to ensure top-flight survival, while the Hatters needed to win to stay up and send City down.\n",

      "With the score 0-0 in the 94th minute, referee Michael Oliver awarded the home side a penalty. Trotta stepped up and thumped it against the crossbar.\n",
      "Rovers immediately broke forward and James Coppinger netted the winner for the visitors at the other end.\n",
      "That goal and results elsewhere meant Doncaster were champions. Brentford finished third and lost to Yeovil in the play-off final.\n",

      "This is the tale of how Jesper Gronkjaer helped Chelsea win four Premier League titles, four FA Cups, the Europa League and the Champions League.\n",
      "That may sound a little far-fetched, but Chelsea could have been a far different club had the Denmark international winger not scored the winner in the Blues' final game of the 2002-03 Premier League campaign against Liverpool.\n",
      "Victory guaranteed Claudio Ranieri's side a place in the following season's Champions League. A few weeks later, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich completed his takeover of Chelsea, who were reported to be £80m in debt at the time.\n",

      "The weapons are used to incapacitate suspects through the use of an electric current.\n",
      "Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Alun Thomas said: \"This decision is not based on specific intelligence of any criminal behaviour or imminent threat, but will allow us the option to deploy Taser devices where, in the course of their duty, an officer needs to protect the public or themselves by using force.\n",
      "\"The current threat to the UK from international terrorism remains 'severe', meaning an attack is highly likely.\n",
      "\"Recent terrorist attacks across the world are a stark reminder that the threat from terrorism is a genuine risk, and it is important that we keep our security measures and operational tactics under constant review.\"\n",

      "He said: \"In our assessment, the introduction of Taser devices in Scotland is a proportionate response and provides an additional option for our officers to consider when confronted with a genuine threat to themselves or the public.\n",

      "\"Undoubtedly the use of the Taser device in this incident prevented even further harm to the travelling public.\"\n",
      "\"We believe that the public in Scotland deserve the same level of protection as people elsewhere on the rail network.\"\n",
      "British Transport Police said they reached the decision on Tasers following \"detailed discussions\" with Police Scotland.\n",

      "The force refused to reveal how many officers would receive the training required to carry Tasers \"for security reasons\".\n",

      "Changes to the Housing Act in Wales, introduced in 2015, removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation.\n",
      "Prison Link Cymru, which helps people find accommodation after their release, said things were generally good for women because issues such as children or domestic violence were now considered.\n",
      "However, the same could not be said for men, the charity said, because issues which often affect them, such as post traumatic stress disorder or drug dependency, were often viewed as less of a priority.\n",
      "Andrew Stevens, who works in Welsh prisons trying to secure housing for prison leavers, said the need for accommodation was \"chronic\".\n",
      "\"There's a desperate need for it, finding suitable accommodation for those leaving prison there is just a lack of it everywhere,\" he said.\n",
      "\"It could take six months to a year, without a lot of help they could be on the streets for six months.\n",
      "\"When you think of the consequences of either being on the street, especially with the cold weather at the moment or you may have a roof over your head, sometimes there is only one choice.\"\n",
      "Mr Stevens believes building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem.\n",
      "\"The average price is a hundred pounds a week to keep someone in a rented flat, prison is a lot more than that so I would imagine it would save the public purse quite a few pounds,\" he said.\n",
      "Official figures show 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, of an overall total of 6,900 new properties in Wales.\n",
      "Marc, 50, who has been in and out of prison for the past 20 years for burglary offences, said he struggled to find accommodation each time he was released.\n",
      "He said he would ask himself: \"Where am I going to stay? Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\"\n",
      "\"You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it. It's like every man for himself, there's nothing.\"\n",
      "Marc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing.\n",
      "\"You feel safe, you got hot food, you've got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It's a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said.\n",
      "Tom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available.\n",
      "\"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven't got accommodation and haven't got provision,\" he said.\n",
      "\"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't.\n",
      "\"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\"\n",
      "A Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.\n",
