(.) Why Now? © Common Enterprise Pain Points Call Centers are evolving. Since their inception in the 1970s when companies mostly routed calls between departments; to the early 2000s where agents were no longer just answering calls, they were also fielding emails, chats and social media interactions. Fast forward to today, we're going through another big wave. As companies try to support these additional channels and interactions they have increasingly looked to cloud and AI technologies to help. AI is the last puzzle piece to help handle the ever-increasing volume, by automating customer interactions and delivering fast, relevant actions and answers . 62% of companies are currently modernizing their call centers and 81% of customers say the want more self-service options. However, because only 2% of calls are currently assisted with AI, customers and agents are struggling to get the answers they need in a timely manner. With AI, our clients can extract insights from documents and interactions to assist human agents, simplify self service, spot trends to optimize performance, contain 70% of calls without human interaction and save per contained call to reduce operational expenses These powerful capabilities can create a frictionless self-serve experience for human agents and customers. ¢ ( High Call Center Volume 69 7 D Low Customer Satisfaction High Technology and maintenance costs High call time to resolution High Agent Turnover High Customer effort © Customer Journey LO © 1.

They use large volumes of\\ndata, machine learning, and natural language processing to help imitate human\\ninteractions, recognizing speech and text inputs and translating their meanings\\nacross various languages.\\n\\nUse IBM Watson® Assistant to build your own branded live chatbot into any\\ndevice, application, or channel. Your chatbot, which is also known as an\\nassistant, connects to the customer engagement resources you already use to\\ndeliver an engaging, unified problem-solving experience to your customers.\\n\\nCreate AI-driven conversational flows\\nYour assistant leverages industry-leading AI capabilities to understand\\nquestions that your customers ask in natural language. It uses machine\\nlearning models that are custom built from your data to deliver accurate\\nanswers in real time.\\n\\nEmbed existing help content\\nYou already know the answers to customer questions? Put your subject matter\\nexpertise to work. Add a search skill to give your assistant access to\\ncorporate data collections that it can mine for answers.\\n\\nConnect to your customer service teams\\nIf customers need more help or want to discuss a topic that requires a\\npersonal touch, connect them to human agents from your existing service\\ndesk provider.\\n\\nBring the assistant to your customers, where they are\\nConfigure one or more built-in integrations to quickly publish your assistant\\non popular social media platforms such as Slack, Facebook Messenger, Intercom,\\nor WhatsApp. Turn the assistant into a member of your customer support call\\ncenter team, where it can answer the phone and address simple requests so its\\nhuman teammates can focus on more nuanced customer needs. Make your assistant\\nthe go-to help resource for customers by adding it as a chat widget to your\\ncompany website. If none of the built-in integrations fit your needs, use the\\nAPIs to build your own custom app.\\n\\nTrack customer engagement and satisfaction\\nUse built-in metrics to analyze logs from conversations between customers and\\nyour assistant to gauge how well it's doing and identify areas for improvement.\\n</td>\n",

(.) Why Now? © Common Enterprise Pain Points Call Centers are evolving. Since their inception in the 1970s when companies mostly routed calls between departments; to the early 2000s where agents were no longer just answering calls, they were also fielding emails, chats and social media interactions. Fast forward to today, we're going through another big wave. As companies try to support these additional channels and interactions they have increasingly looked to cloud and AI technologies to help. AI is the last puzzle piece to help handle the ever-increasing volume, by automating customer interactions and delivering fast, relevant actions and answers . 62% of companies are currently modernizing their call centers and 81% of customers say the want more self-service options. However, because only 2% of calls are currently assisted with AI, customers and agents are struggling to get the answers they need in a timely manner. With AI, our clients can extract insights from documents and interactions to assist human agents, simplify self service, spot trends to optimize performance, contain 70% of calls without human interaction and save per contained call to reduce operational expenses These powerful capabilities can create a frictionless self-serve experience for human agents and customers. ¢ ( High Call Center Volume 69 7 D Low Customer Satisfaction High Technology and maintenance costs High call time to resolution High Agent Turnover High Customer effort © Customer Journey LO © 1.

(.) Why Now? © Common Enterprise Pain Points Call Centers are evolving. Since their inception in the 1970s when companies mostly routed calls between departments; to the early 2000s where agents were no longer just answering calls, they were also fielding emails, chats and social media interactions. Fast forward to today, we're going through another big wave. As companies try to support these additional channels and interactions they have increasingly looked to cloud and AI technologies to help. AI is the last puzzle piece to help handle the ever-increasing volume, by automating customer interactions and delivering fast, relevant actions and answers . 62% of companies are currently modernizing their call centers and 81% of customers say the want more self-service options. However, because only 2% of calls are currently assisted with AI, customers and agents are struggling to get the answers they need in a timely manner. With AI, our clients can extract insights from documents and interactions to assist human agents, simplify self service, spot trends to optimize performance, contain 70% of calls without human interaction and save per contained call to reduce operational expenses These powerful capabilities can create a frictionless self-serve experience for human agents and customers. ¢ ( High Call Center Volume 69 7 D Low Customer Satisfaction High Technology and maintenance costs High call time to resolution High Agent Turnover High Customer effort © Customer Journey LO © 1.

       "      <td>Cloud Pak for Data 4.6 Code Experience with VS Code Integration - This article gives an overview of the code experience for data scientists in Watson Studio on Cloud Pak for Data 4.6. We cover the new improved VS Code Desktop integration, JupyterLab- and RStudio- integration. VS Code desktop integration lets data scientists use a familiar IDE to run and debug code that runs on the Cloud Pak for Data cluster. This enforces permissions and privacy rules defined in Cloud Pak for Data, like when using built-in tools. We show how the new Watson Studio extension for VS Code makes it easy to connect to Python runtime environments within Cloud Pak for Data projects. We explain how to develop and run code therein, with secure access to data in the context of the project. \\n With Watson Studio on Cloud Pak for Data, we support a range of tools and IDEs integrated with projects. Data scientists can work with Python and R, using a wide range of libraries. Watson Studio libraries give access to data connections and assets in a project. They also allow saving model- or data assets to the project, and provide access to spaces and catalogs. The following diagram shows the options for use of IDEs with Git-based projects on Cloud Pak for Data. \\n JupyterLab and RStudio in Watson Studio allow users to collaborate on code in Git-based projects. They exchange code via push/pull between per-user environments and the project’s Git Repo. They can also use VS Code, PyCharm, JupyterLab, … on their desktops to contribute code to a project’s Git repo. \\n New in Cloud Pak for Data 4.6, we provide a Watson Studio Extension for VS Code. It allows use of VS Code desktop as the UI to run and debug code inside Python runtime environments in projects on the Cloud Pak for Data cluster. This allows using compute and secure access to data in that context. Like when using built-in tools, permissions, masking, privacy rules, … defined within Cloud Pak for Data apply. \\n Data scientists can release code via the project’s associated Git repository. They can create release tags for operations staff or CI/CD pipelines to consume. Consumers can extract code for a release tag from the repository. They can import it as a Code Package into a Space on Cloud Pak for Data and run the code as a job or deployment. Or they can deploy and use the code elsewhere as they see fit. \\n Data scientists can use Notebooks to prepare and analyze data, to train and evaluate models, and to visualize results. Notebooks consist of a sequence of code cells with Python or R code, output cells for results, and markup cells for explanation. \\n For development of larger amounts of Python code with many files and/or Notebooks, Watson Studio embeds the JupyterLab IDE. In the context of a project, it integrates with a project’s Git repo for code management. The following screen shows a Notebook in JupyterLab in a project. The Notebook contains code generated by Insert-to-Code from the side bar, to access and display a data asset from the project. \\n Customers can extend JupyterLab in Cloud Pak for Data by creating custom images. Derived from the Watson Studio JupyterLab/Python base image, they can can add JupyterLab Extensions as needed. \\n VS Code supports Python development with debugging, code completion, and many useful extensions. Its Git-integration allows development and contribution of code from VS Code to Git-based projects in Cloud Pak for Data. \\n The new Watson Studio Extension for VS Code allows to also connect to Python runtime environment in Git-based projects on Cloud Pak for Data. It creates a secure HTTPS connection from the user’s desktop to the Cloud Pak for Data cluster. Users can work in the familiar VS Code IDE. From that UI they can run and debug their code in Python runtime environments — such as CPU, GPU, Spark, custom environments — on Cloud Pak for Data. Running in that context, their code can use the Watson Studio project library to access assets and data connections within in the</td>\n",

This first post focuses on migrating Spark jobs from Hadoop to IBM Analytics Engine Powered by Apache Spark on IBM Cloud Pak for Data. \\n There are a number of articles that have been written , providing the storage and compute perspectives of moving away from Hadoop (please see the references section of this post for links to some of them). From a compute perspective, having a single Kubernetes-based cluster simplifies infrastructure management and reduces cost by having to maintain a single cluster for Spark and non-Spark payloads, unlike Hadoop which requires a dedicated cluster for Spark payloads and other options for things like user interfaces and developer tools. From a storage perspective, moving from HDFS-based storage to cloud-based storage is driven by the cost effectiveness, scalability and durability of the latter. \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data simplifies and automates how data is collected, organized, and analyzed by businesses that want to infuse AI across their organization. The Analytics Engine powered by Apache Spark (hereafter referred to as Analytics Engine) is an add-on that provides the compute engine needed to run analytical and machine learning jobs on the Kubernetes cluster hosted on IBM Cloud Pak for Data. The Analytics Engine provides a single central point of control for creating and managing Spark environments in the cloud. It supports all essential features such as: \\n This post provides the details of some of the key steps which can help in accelerating the migration of Spark jobs from Hadoop to IBM Cloud Pak for Data.

       "      <td>Collect, Govern and Analyze Hadoop Data using IBM Cloud Pak for Data - Written by Basem Elasioty and Gregor Meyer \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data is a cloud-native solution that enables data scientists, data engineers and business experts to collaborate defining, developing, validating and deploying analytic products. It provides the needed tools for data science projects including connectivity to various data sources, governing and organizing data, training and evaluating AI and ML models and finally deploying these models and infuse them into business processes. \\n Many companies have collected huge volumes of data in their data lakes, often implemented using Hadoop. It is required to leverage this data along with other traditional data sources to enable successful data science projects that utilize all enterprise data without barriers. \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data enables many different ways to connect to Hadoop data in a secured and managed way. This includes accessing HDFS files as well as relational data in Hive databases. Under the covers, Cloud Pak for Data can connect to remote Hadoop clusters using various APIs such as WebHDFS, Livy, and JDBC. \\n The Hadoop ecosystem provides numerous different tools and access methods. This enables building a large variety of solutions on top of Hadoop. But the features can also be overwhelming to data analysts and data scientists who are not necessarily familiar with all those tools and APIs. Instead they need simple methods for analyzing the data quickly. \\n Security requirements can represent another hurdle that users need to overcome. Companies often place their Hadoop system behind a firewall and control access using, e.g., Kerberos. \\n These issues are addressed by IBM Cloud Pak for Data and its Hadoop Execution Engine service. This allows users to exploit the breadth of data and the scalability of their large Hadoop systems. \\n Hadoop Execution Engine \\n A key component in the architecture of IBM Cloud Pak for Data working together with Hadoop is the Hadoop Execution Engine. This is add-on service that can be installed separately as part of Cloud Pak for Data offering and enables Hadoop data access and push workload to remote Spark cluster. \\n It gets installed on an edge node of a Hadoop cluster and acts as a safe gateway between a Cloud Pak for Data and Hadoop. It manages security aspects such as Kerberos and allows only Cloud Pak for Data authorized users to access Hadoop data and run jobs on remote Spark cluster. \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data can be connected to multiple Hadoop systems provided that each of them has the Hadoop Execution Engine installed. Similarly, a single gateway can handle connections from multiple Cloud Pak for Data platforms. High availability of the gateway on edge nodes is also supported. \\n Collect Hadoop Data \\n Connections to Hadoop data can be made via Hadoop Execution Engine or natively through direct access to Hadoop endpoints like WebHDFS or through JDBC to Hive. Using Hadoop Execution Engine ensure the connections are managed and secured by Execution Engine gateway with high availability supported. Cloud Pak for Data users can create these connections and use it later within Cloud Pak for Data different services, such as analytics projects, transform projects, data governance,.. etc. \\n Data Virtualization for Hadoop Data \\n The Data virtualization add-on in Cloud Pak for Data enables you to create data sets from disparate data sources so that you can query and use the data as if it came from a single source. Hive data sets are also supported in the data virtualization add-on via the built-in “Hive JDBC” connection type. When Data virtualization is enabled, you can virtualize Hive data sources and start using it by running queries with ability to join Hive tables with other data sources. \\n Organize Hadoop Data \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data provides functionality to govern big data assets to enable business users, data engineers, and data architects manage these assets wi</td>\n",

This is our second feature release in 2022, only 5 months after the release of 4.5. Churning out a high quality feature releases in such short span is no game and this was made possible through the dedication, planning, and hard work of the entire team. \\n Cloud Pak for Data enables organizations to get the most out of their data — encompassing the capabilities of 40+ IBM and partner services that are continually expanding. \\n As our product has matured, our focus has shifted from not only building new features but to also doubling down on what makes us unique in the market — enterprise readiness, robustness and resiliency — making Cloud Pak for Data the best choice for enterprise production workloads. Version 4.6 expands and solidifies upon the capabilities of 4.5, and also introduces some new features and services. As a reminder, this highly anticipated release, as well as all subsequent releases, follows the Cloud Pak for Data lifecycle, which we modeled to fulfill a wide range of customer needs. \\n Below is a summary of what to expect from the Cloud Pak for Data 4.6 platform. \\n Support for NetApp Storage \\n Cloud Pak for Data is now certified to support NetApp ONTAP v22.4.0 or later via Netapp Trident CSI drivers. NetApp’s best-of-breed on-premises and cloud-native data management technologies will ensure robust datastore availability across the board for Cloud Pak for Data workloads. Snapshot-based online backups and restore on same cluster are supported in order to provide uninterrupted operation. \\n Cloud Pak for Data with Spectrum Fusion \\n Cloud Pak for Data is now fully integrated with IBM Spectrum Fusion and IBM Spectrum Fusion HCI, which enables running data and AI workloads including online backups and restore to same or a different clusters. Although Disaster Recovery and Data Protection for Cloud Pak for Data via Spectrum Fusion was introduced in 4.5.3, we made additional improvements in 4.6 making it more reliable and seamless. \\n Compliance Updates \\n In order to keep providing its services to government customers and expand further into federal markets, Cloud Pak for Data has taken the effort to improve &amp; verify its ops on a CIS (Center of Internet Security) hardened Openshift. \\n For the uninitiated, CIS provides benchmark and guideline for set of vendor-agnostic, internationally recognized secure configuration guidelines for various platforms such as Operating systems, Cloud infrastructure, Servers software etc. CIS Kubernetes &amp; OpenShift hardening guidelines are quickly becoming industry standards for containerized workloads and Cloud Pak for Data coming out clean on CIS benchmark is going to be a big deal for our security savvy customers. \\n Monitoring Features \\n In our effort to simplify day 2 operations for Cloud Pak for Data admins, the product will introduce new “Alerts” cards on the homepage which will link to the “Events and alerts” page within Monitoring. This will display critical and warning alerts on the homepage itself. The “Events and alerts” page has also been redesigned to include an interactive bubble graph. These changes were intended to make monitoring more discoverable for administrators. \\n In addition to this, the new “Alert Forwarding” tab in the Configurations page will allow administrators to set up email, SNMP, or Slack notifications to users and can be easily set up with notifications that are pushed to the admin. Our customers have expressed that such configurations were hidden and hence missed. Cards on the main page would help alleviate this problem and provide a better user experience for admins. \\n Finally, admins also have the ability to check the status of their users (online/offline) in Acces</td>\n",

This first post focuses on integration points of the recently announced joint offering: Cloudera Data Platform for IBM Cloud Pak for Data. The second post will look at how Cloudera Data Platform was installed on IBM Cloud using Ansible. And the third post will focus on lessons learned from installing, maintaining, and verifying the connectivity of the two platforms. Letâs get started!\\nIn this post we will be outlining the main integration points between Cloudera Data Platform and IBM Cloud Pak for Data, and explaining how the two distinct data and AI platforms can communicate with each other. Integrating two platforms is made easy with capabilities available out of the box for both IBM Cloud Pak for Data and Cloudera Data Platform. Establishing a connection between the two is just a few clicks away.\\n\\nArchitecture diagram showing Cloudera Data Plaform for Cloud Pak for Data\\nIn our view, there are three key points to integrating Cloudera Data Platform and IBM Cloud Pak for Data; all other services piggyback on one of these:\\n\\nApache Knox Gateway (available on Cloudera)\\nExecution Engine for Apache Hadoop (available on IBM Cloud Pak for Data)\\nDb2 Big SQL (available on IBM Cloud Pak for Data)\\n\\nRead on for more information about how each integration point works. For a demonstration on how to use data from Hive and Db2 check out the video below where we join the data using Data Virtualization and then display it with IBM Cognos Analytics check out the video below.\\n\\nApache Knox Gateway\\nTo truly be secure, a Hadoop cluster needs Kerberos. However, Kerberos requires a client-side library and complex client-side configuration. This is where the Apache Knox Gateway (âKnoxâ) comes in. By encapsulating Kerberos, Knox eliminates the need for client software or client configuration and, thus, simplifies the access model. Knox integrates with identity management and SSO systems, such as Active Directory and LDAP, to allow identities from these systems to be used for access to Cloudera clusters.\\n\\nKnox dashboard showing the list of supported services\\nCloudera services such as Impala, Hive, and HDFS can be configured with Knox, allowing JDBC connections to easily be created in IBM Cloud Pak for Data.\\n\\nCreating a JDBC connection to Impala via Knox\\n\\nList of connections on IBM Cloud Pak for Data\\nExecution Engine for Apache Hadoop\\nThe Execution Engine for Apache Hadoop service is installed on both IBM Cloud Pak for Data and on the worker nodes of a Cloudera Data Platform deployment.

More often than not the answer is a resounding “not very”. Between the proliferation of data types and sources and tightening regulations, data is often held captive, sitting in silos. Traditionally, strategies for overcoming this challenge relied on consolidating the physical data into a single location, structure and vendor. While this strategy seemed great in theory, anyone that has undertaken a migration of this magnitude can tell you it’s easier said than done. \\n Earlier this year at THINK we unveiled our plans for the next generation of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, our alternative to help customers connect the right people to the right data at the right time. Today, I’m excited to share more details on how the latest version of the platform, version 4.0, will bring that vision to life through an intelligent data fabric. \\n Since the launch of IBM Cloud Pak for Data in 2018, our goal has always been to help customers unlock the value of their data and infuse AI throughout their business. Understanding the needs of our clients, we doubled down on delivering a first-of-its-kind containerized platform that provided flexibility to deploy the unique mix of data and AI services a client needs, in the cloud environment of their choice. \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data supports a vibrant ecosystem of proprietary, third party and open source services that we continue to expand on with each release. With version 4.0 we take our efforts to the next level. New capabilities and intelligent automation help business leaders and users tackle the overwhelming data complexity they face to more easily scale the value of their data. \\n A data fabric is an architectural pattern that dynamically orchestrates disparate data sources across a hybrid and multi-cloud landscape to provide business-ready data in support of analytics, AI and applications. The modular and customizable nature of IBM Cloud Pak for Data offers the ideal environment to build a data fabric from best-in-class solutions that is tailored to your unique needs. The tight integration of the microservices within the platform allow for further streamlining of the management and usage of distributed data by infusing intelligent automation. With version 4.0 we’re applying this automation in three key areas: \\n Further augmenting the intelligent automation of our data fabric capabilities is another new service coming to IBM Cloud Pak for Data, IBM Match 360 with Watson. Match 360 provides a machine learning-based, easy to use experience for self-service entity resolution. Non-developers can now match and link data from across their organization, helping to improve overall data quality. \\n IBM SPSS Modeler, IBM Decision Optimization and Hadoop Execution Engine services are also included as part of IBM Cloud Pak for Data 4.0. These capabilities complement the IBM Watson Studio services already within the base and enables users such as business analysts and citizen data scientists, to participate in building AI solutions. \\n AutoAI is enhanced to support relational data sources and generate exportable python code, enabling data scientists to review and update models generated through AutoAI. This is a significant differentiator compared to the AutoML capabilities of competitors, where the generated model is more of a black box. \\n Complementary capabilities are also released on IBM Cloud Pak for Data as a Service, including IBM DataStage and IBM Data Virtualization. Now available fully managed, DataStage helps enable the building of modern data integration pipelines, and the Data Virtualization capability helps to share data across the organization in near real-time, connecting governed data to your AI and ML tools. \\n Finally, IBM Cloud Pak for Data 4.0 includes sev</td>\n",

       "   'text': ' Cloud Pak for Data 4.6 Code Experience with VS Code Integration - This article gives an overview of the code experience for data scientists in Watson Studio on Cloud Pak for Data 4.6. We cover the new improved VS Code Desktop integration, JupyterLab- and RStudio- integration. VS Code desktop integration lets data scientists use a familiar IDE to run and debug code that runs on the Cloud Pak for Data cluster. This enforces permissions and privacy rules defined in Cloud Pak for Data, like when using built-in tools. We show how the new Watson Studio extension for VS Code makes it easy to connect to Python runtime environments within Cloud Pak for Data projects. We explain how to develop and run code therein, with secure access to data in the context of the project. \\n With Watson Studio on Cloud Pak for Data, we support a range of tools and IDEs integrated with projects. Data scientists can work with Python and R, using a wide range of libraries. Watson Studio libraries give access to data connections and assets in a project. They also allow saving model- or data assets to the project, and provide access to spaces and catalogs. The following diagram shows the options for use of IDEs with Git-based projects on Cloud Pak for Data. \\n JupyterLab and RStudio in Watson Studio allow users to collaborate on code in Git-based projects. They exchange code via push/pull between per-user environments and the project’s Git Repo. They can also use VS Code, PyCharm, JupyterLab, … on their desktops to contribute code to a project’s Git repo. \\n New in Cloud Pak for Data 4.6, we provide a Watson Studio Extension for VS Code. It allows use of VS Code desktop as the UI to run and debug code inside Python runtime environments in projects on the Cloud Pak for Data cluster. This allows using compute and secure access to data in that context. Like when using built-in tools, permissions, masking, privacy rules, … defined within Cloud Pak for Data apply. \\n Data scientists can release code via the project’s associated Git repository. They can create release tags for operations staff or CI/CD pipelines to consume. Consumers can extract code for a release tag from the repository. They can import it as a Code Package into a Space on Cloud Pak for Data and run the code as a job or deployment. Or they can deploy and use the code elsewhere as they see fit. \\n Data scientists can use Notebooks to prepare and analyze data, to train and evaluate models, and to visualize results. Notebooks consist of a sequence of code cells with Python or R code, output cells for results, and markup cells for explanation. \\n For development of larger amounts of Python code with many files and/or Notebooks, Watson Studio embeds the JupyterLab IDE. In the context of a project, it integrates with a project’s Git repo for code management. The following screen shows a Notebook in JupyterLab in a project. The Notebook contains code generated by Insert-to-Code from the side bar, to access and display a data asset from the project. \\n Customers can extend JupyterLab in Cloud Pak for Data by creating custom images. Derived from the Watson Studio JupyterLab/Python base image, they can can add JupyterLab Extensions as needed. \\n VS Code supports Python development with debugging, code completion, and many useful extensions. Its Git-integration allows development and contribution of code from VS Code to Git-based projects in Cloud Pak for Data. \\n The new Watson Studio Extension for VS Code allows to also connect to Python runtime environment in Git-based projects on Cloud Pak for Data. It creates a secure HTTPS connection from the user’s desktop to the Cloud Pak for Data cluster. Users can work in the familiar VS Code IDE. From that UI they can run and debug their code in Python runtime environments — such as CPU, GPU, Spark, custom environments — on Cloud Pak for Data. Running in that context, their code can use the Watson Studio project library to access assets and data connections within in the',\n",

This first post focuses on migrating Spark jobs from Hadoop to IBM Analytics Engine Powered by Apache Spark on IBM Cloud Pak for Data. \\n There are a number of articles that have been written , providing the storage and compute perspectives of moving away from Hadoop (please see the references section of this post for links to some of them). From a compute perspective, having a single Kubernetes-based cluster simplifies infrastructure management and reduces cost by having to maintain a single cluster for Spark and non-Spark payloads, unlike Hadoop which requires a dedicated cluster for Spark payloads and other options for things like user interfaces and developer tools. From a storage perspective, moving from HDFS-based storage to cloud-based storage is driven by the cost effectiveness, scalability and durability of the latter. \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data simplifies and automates how data is collected, organized, and analyzed by businesses that want to infuse AI across their organization. The Analytics Engine powered by Apache Spark (hereafter referred to as Analytics Engine) is an add-on that provides the compute engine needed to run analytical and machine learning jobs on the Kubernetes cluster hosted on IBM Cloud Pak for Data. The Analytics Engine provides a single central point of control for creating and managing Spark environments in the cloud. It supports all essential features such as: \\n This post provides the details of some of the key steps which can help in accelerating the migration of Spark jobs from Hadoop to IBM Cloud Pak for Data. In this context, this post refers to the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) which is one of the popular platforms for running Spark payloads on HDFS. On the Cloud Pak for Data side, this post refers to NFS as the storage option. \\n This blog is intended for developers who are at a beginner to intermediate level experience in using Spark on HDP (Yarn) and are getting started migrating Spark jobs to IBM Cloud Pak for Data. \\n Note : This document assumes basic understanding of running Spark jobs on HDP and on Analytics Engine Powered By Spark. Please see the references section for more information on how to install and use Analytics Engine Powered by Spark on IBM Cloud Pak for Data \\n The contents of this blog are based on IBM Cloud Pak For Data 3.5.2 (Spark version 2.4) and HDP version 3.0 \\n Note: The Analytics Engine powered by Apache Spark on IBM Cloud Pak for Data at the time of this writing supports Spark 2.4, Spark 2.4.7 and Spark 3.0. \\n Before getting into the details of the actual job migration steps, it is essential to understand the key architectural differences between Yarn architecture and Analytics Engine architecture with respect to Spark job submissions. The following table summarizes the key differences: \\n The following figure provides a high level view of these differences : \\n The key points to note from the above figure are : \\n Note : This blog focuses specifically on NFS as the storage class for the Spark jobs on the Analytics Engine.

       "   'text': ' Collect, Govern and Analyze Hadoop Data using IBM Cloud Pak for\\xa0Data - Written by Basem Elasioty and Gregor Meyer \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data is a cloud-native solution that enables data scientists, data engineers and business experts to collaborate defining, developing, validating and deploying analytic products. It provides the needed tools for data science projects including connectivity to various data sources, governing and organizing data, training and evaluating AI and ML models and finally deploying these models and infuse them into business processes. \\n Many companies have collected huge volumes of data in their data lakes, often implemented using Hadoop. It is required to leverage this data along with other traditional data sources to enable successful data science projects that utilize all enterprise data without barriers. \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data enables many different ways to connect to Hadoop data in a secured and managed way. This includes accessing HDFS files as well as relational data in Hive databases. Under the covers, Cloud Pak for Data can connect to remote Hadoop clusters using various APIs such as WebHDFS, Livy, and JDBC. \\n The Hadoop ecosystem provides numerous different tools and access methods. This enables building a large variety of solutions on top of Hadoop. But the features can also be overwhelming to data analysts and data scientists who are not necessarily familiar with all those tools and APIs. Instead they need simple methods for analyzing the data quickly. \\n Security requirements can represent another hurdle that users need to overcome. Companies often place their Hadoop system behind a firewall and control access using, e.g., Kerberos. \\n These issues are addressed by IBM Cloud Pak for Data and its Hadoop Execution Engine service. This allows users to exploit the breadth of data and the scalability of their large Hadoop systems. \\n Hadoop Execution Engine \\n A key component in the architecture of IBM Cloud Pak for Data working together with Hadoop is the Hadoop Execution Engine. This is add-on service that can be installed separately as part of Cloud Pak for Data offering and enables Hadoop data access and push workload to remote Spark cluster. \\n It gets installed on an edge node of a Hadoop cluster and acts as a safe gateway between a Cloud Pak for Data and Hadoop. It manages security aspects such as Kerberos and allows only Cloud Pak for Data authorized users to access Hadoop data and run jobs on remote Spark cluster. \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data can be connected to multiple Hadoop systems provided that each of them has the Hadoop Execution Engine installed. Similarly, a single gateway can handle connections from multiple Cloud Pak for Data platforms. High availability of the gateway on edge nodes is also supported. \\n Collect Hadoop Data \\n Connections to Hadoop data can be made via Hadoop Execution Engine or natively through direct access to Hadoop endpoints like WebHDFS or through JDBC to Hive. Using Hadoop Execution Engine ensure the connections are managed and secured by Execution Engine gateway with high availability supported. Cloud Pak for Data users can create these connections and use it later within Cloud Pak for Data different services, such as analytics projects, transform projects, data governance,.. etc. \\n Data Virtualization for Hadoop Data \\n The Data virtualization add-on in Cloud Pak for Data enables you to create data sets from disparate data sources so that you can query and use the data as if it came from a single source. Hive data sets are also supported in the data virtualization add-on via the built-in “Hive JDBC” connection type. When Data virtualization is enabled, you can virtualize Hive data sources and start using it by running queries with ability to join Hive tables with other data sources. \\n Organize Hadoop Data \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data provides functionality to govern big data assets to enable business users, data engineers, and data architects manage these assets wi',\n",

This is our second feature release in 2022, only 5 months after the release of 4.5. Churning out a high quality feature releases in such short span is no game and this was made possible through the dedication, planning, and hard work of the entire team. \\n Cloud Pak for Data enables organizations to get the most out of their data — encompassing the capabilities of 40+ IBM and partner services that are continually expanding. \\n As our product has matured, our focus has shifted from not only building new features but to also doubling down on what makes us unique in the market — enterprise readiness, robustness and resiliency — making Cloud Pak for Data the best choice for enterprise production workloads. Version 4.6 expands and solidifies upon the capabilities of 4.5, and also introduces some new features and services. As a reminder, this highly anticipated release, as well as all subsequent releases, follows the Cloud Pak for Data lifecycle, which we modeled to fulfill a wide range of customer needs. \\n Below is a summary of what to expect from the Cloud Pak for Data 4.6 platform. \\n Support for NetApp Storage \\n Cloud Pak for Data is now certified to support NetApp ONTAP v22.4.0 or later via Netapp Trident CSI drivers. NetApp’s best-of-breed on-premises and cloud-native data management technologies will ensure robust datastore availability across the board for Cloud Pak for Data workloads. Snapshot-based online backups and restore on same cluster are supported in order to provide uninterrupted operation. \\n Cloud Pak for Data with Spectrum Fusion \\n Cloud Pak for Data is now fully integrated with IBM Spectrum Fusion and IBM Spectrum Fusion HCI, which enables running data and AI workloads including online backups and restore to same or a different clusters. Although Disaster Recovery and Data Protection for Cloud Pak for Data via Spectrum Fusion was introduced in 4.5.3, we made additional improvements in 4.6 making it more reliable and seamless. \\n Compliance Updates \\n In order to keep providing its services to government customers and expand further into federal markets, Cloud Pak for Data has taken the effort to improve & verify its ops on a CIS (Center of Internet Security) hardened Openshift. \\n For the uninitiated, CIS provides benchmark and guideline for set of vendor-agnostic, internationally recognized secure configuration guidelines for various platforms such as Operating systems, Cloud infrastructure, Servers software etc. CIS Kubernetes & OpenShift hardening guidelines are quickly becoming industry standards for containerized workloads and Cloud Pak for Data coming out clean on CIS benchmark is going to be a big deal for our security savvy customers. \\n Monitoring Features \\n In our effort to simplify day 2 operations for Cloud Pak for Data admins, the product will introduce new “Alerts” cards on the homepage which will link to the “Events and alerts” page within Monitoring. This will display critical and warning alerts on the homepage itself. The “Events and alerts” page has also been redesigned to include an interactive bubble graph. These changes were intended to make monitoring more discoverable for administrators. \\n In addition to this, the new “Alert Forwarding” tab in the Configurations page will allow administrators to set up email, SNMP, or Slack notifications to users and can be easily set up with notifications that are pushed to the admin. Our customers have expressed that such configurations were hidden and hence missed. Cards on the main page would help alleviate this problem and provide a better user experience for admins. \\n Finally, admins also have the ability to check the status of their users (online/offline) in Acces',\n",

More often than not the answer is a resounding “not very”. Between the proliferation of data types and sources and tightening regulations, data is often held captive, sitting in silos. Traditionally, strategies for overcoming this challenge relied on consolidating the physical data into a single location, structure and vendor. While this strategy seemed great in theory, anyone that has undertaken a migration of this magnitude can tell you it’s easier said than done. \\n Earlier this year at THINK we unveiled our plans for the next generation of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, our alternative to help customers connect the right people to the right data at the right time. Today, I’m excited to share more details on how the latest version of the platform, version 4.0, will bring that vision to life through an intelligent data fabric. \\n Since the launch of IBM Cloud Pak for Data in 2018, our goal has always been to help customers unlock the value of their data and infuse AI throughout their business. Understanding the needs of our clients, we doubled down on delivering a first-of-its-kind containerized platform that provided flexibility to deploy the unique mix of data and AI services a client needs, in the cloud environment of their choice. \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data supports a vibrant ecosystem of proprietary, third party and open source services that we continue to expand on with each release. With version 4.0 we take our efforts to the next level. New capabilities and intelligent automation help business leaders and users tackle the overwhelming data complexity they face to more easily scale the value of their data. \\n A data fabric is an architectural pattern that dynamically orchestrates disparate data sources across a hybrid and multi-cloud landscape to provide business-ready data in support of analytics, AI and applications. The modular and customizable nature of IBM Cloud Pak for Data offers the ideal environment to build a data fabric from best-in-class solutions that is tailored to your unique needs. The tight integration of the microservices within the platform allow for further streamlining of the management and usage of distributed data by infusing intelligent automation. With version 4.0 we’re applying this automation in three key areas: \\n Further augmenting the intelligent automation of our data fabric capabilities is another new service coming to IBM Cloud Pak for Data, IBM Match 360 with Watson. Match 360 provides a machine learning-based, easy to use experience for self-service entity resolution. Non-developers can now match and link data from across their organization, helping to improve overall data quality. \\n IBM SPSS Modeler, IBM Decision Optimization and Hadoop Execution Engine services are also included as part of IBM Cloud Pak for Data 4.0. These capabilities complement the IBM Watson Studio services already within the base and enables users such as business analysts and citizen data scientists, to participate in building AI solutions. \\n AutoAI is enhanced to support relational data sources and generate exportable python code, enabling data scientists to review and update models generated through AutoAI. This is a significant differentiator compared to the AutoML capabilities of competitors, where the generated model is more of a black box. \\n Complementary capabilities are also released on IBM Cloud Pak for Data as a Service, including IBM DataStage and IBM Data Virtualization. Now available fully managed, DataStage helps enable the building of modern data integration pipelines, and the Data Virtualization capability helps to share data across the organization in near real-time, connecting governed data to your AI and ML tools. \\n Finally, IBM Cloud Pak for Data 4.0 includes sev',\n",

This first post focuses on migrating Spark jobs from Hadoop to IBM Analytics Engine Powered by Apache Spark on IBM Cloud Pak for Data. \\n There are a number of articles that have been written , providing the storage and compute perspectives of moving away from Hadoop (please see the references section of this post for links to some of them). From a compute perspective, having a single Kubernetes-based cluster simplifies infrastructure management and reduces cost by having to maintain a single cluster for Spark and non-Spark payloads, unlike Hadoop which requires a dedicated cluster for Spark payloads and other options for things like user interfaces and developer tools. From a storage perspective, moving from HDFS-based storage to cloud-based storage is driven by the cost effectiveness, scalability and durability of the latter. \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data simplifies and automates how data is collected, organized, and analyzed by businesses that want to infuse AI across their organization. The Analytics Engine powered by Apache Spark (hereafter referred to as Analytics Engine) is an add-on that provides the compute engine needed to run analytical and machine learning jobs on the Kubernetes cluster hosted on IBM Cloud Pak for Data. The Analytics Engine provides a single central point of control for creating and managing Spark environments in the cloud. It supports all essential features such as: \\n This post provides the details of some of the key steps which can help in accelerating the migration of Spark jobs from Hadoop to IBM Cloud Pak for Data. In this context, this post refers to the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) which is one of the popular platforms for running Spark payloads on HDFS. On the Cloud Pak for Data side, this post refers to NFS as the storage option. \\n This blog is intended for developers who are at a beginner to intermediate level experience in using Spark on HDP (Yarn) and are getting started migrating Spark jobs to IBM Cloud Pak for Data. \\n Note : This document assumes basic understanding of running Spark jobs on HDP and on Analytics Engine Powered By Spark. Please see the references section for more information on how to install and use Analytics Engine Powered by Spark on IBM Cloud Pak for Data \\n The contents of this blog are based on IBM Cloud Pak For Data 3.5.2 (Spark version 2.4) and HDP version 3.0 \\n Note: The Analytics Engine powered by Apache Spark on IBM Cloud Pak for Data at the time of this writing supports Spark 2.4, Spark 2.4.7 and Spark 3.0. \\n Before getting into the details of the actual job migration steps, it is essential to understand the key architectural differences between Yarn architecture and Analytics Engine architecture with respect to Spark job submissions. The following table summarizes the key differences: \\n The following figure provides a high level view of these differences : \\n The key points to note from the above figure are : \\n Note : This blog focuses specifically on NFS as the storage class for the Spark jobs on the Analytics Engine.

And the third post will focus on lessons learned from installing, maintaining, and verifying the connectivity of the two platforms. Letâs get started!\\nIn this post we will be outlining the main integration points between Cloudera Data Platform and IBM Cloud Pak for Data, and explaining how the two distinct data and AI platforms can communicate with each other. Integrating two platforms is made easy with capabilities available out of the box for both IBM Cloud Pak for Data and Cloudera Data Platform.

However, Kerberos requires a client-side library and complex client-side configuration. This is where the Apache Knox Gateway (âKnoxâ) comes in. By encapsulating Kerberos, Knox eliminates the need for client software or client configuration and, thus, simplifies the access model. Knox integrates with identity management and SSO systems, such as Active Directory and LDAP, to allow identities from these systems to be used for access to Cloudera clusters.\\n\\nKnox dashboard showing the list of supported services\\nCloudera services such as Impala, Hive, and HDFS can be configured with Knox, allowing JDBC connections to easily be created in IBM Cloud Pak for Data.\\n\\nCreating a JDBC connection to Impala via Knox\\n\\nList of connections on IBM Cloud Pak for Data\\nExecution Engine for Apache Hadoop\\nThe Execution Engine for Apache Hadoop service is installed on both IBM Cloud Pak for Data and on the worker nodes of a Cloudera Data Platform deployment.

It provides the needed tools for data science projects including connectivity to various data sources, governing and organizing data, training and evaluating AI and ML models and finally deploying these models and infuse them into business processes. \\n Many companies have collected huge volumes of data in their data lakes, often implemented using Hadoop. It is required to leverage this data along with other traditional data sources to enable successful data science projects that utilize all enterprise data without barriers. \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data enables many different ways to connect to Hadoop data in a secured and managed way. This includes accessing HDFS files as well as relational data in Hive databases. Under the covers, Cloud Pak for Data can connect to remote Hadoop clusters using various APIs such as WebHDFS, Livy, and JDBC. \\n The Hadoop ecosystem provides numerous different tools and access methods. This enables building a large variety of solutions on top of Hadoop. But the features can also be overwhelming to data analysts and data scientists who are not necessarily familiar with all those tools and APIs. Instead they need simple methods for analyzing the data quickly. \\n Security requirements can represent another hurdle that users need to overcome. Companies often place their Hadoop system behind a firewall and control access using, e.g., Kerberos. \\n These issues are addressed by IBM Cloud Pak for Data and its Hadoop Execution Engine service. This allows users to exploit the breadth of data and the scalability of their large Hadoop systems. \\n Hadoop Execution Engine \\n A key component in the architecture of IBM Cloud Pak for Data working together with Hadoop is the Hadoop Execution Engine. This is add-on service that can be installed separately as part of Cloud Pak for Data offering and enables Hadoop data access and push workload to remote Spark cluster. \\n It gets installed on an edge node of a Hadoop cluster and acts as a safe gateway between a Cloud Pak for Data and Hadoop. It manages security aspects such as Kerberos and allows only Cloud Pak for Data authorized users to access Hadoop data and run jobs on remote Spark cluster. \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data can be connected to multiple Hadoop systems provided that each of them has the Hadoop Execution Engine installed. Similarly, a single gateway can handle connections from multiple Cloud Pak for Data platforms. High availability of the gateway on edge nodes is also supported. \\n Collect Hadoop Data \\n Connections to Hadoop data can be made via Hadoop Execution Engine or natively through direct access to Hadoop endpoints like WebHDFS or through JDBC to Hive. Using Hadoop Execution Engine ensure the connections are managed and secured by Execution Engine gateway with high availability supported. Cloud Pak for Data users can create these connections and use it later within Cloud Pak for Data different services, such as analytics projects, transform projects, data governance,.. etc. \\n Data Virtualization for Hadoop Data \\n The Data virtualization add-on in Cloud Pak for Data enables you to create data sets from disparate data sources so that you can query and use the data as if it came from a single source. Hive data sets are also supported in the data virtualization add-on via the built-in “Hive JDBC” connection type.

       "      <td>Cloud Pak for Data v4.6 - Holidays are right around the corner and most of us working hard to start the season on a good note and end the year with accomplishments. \\n I am proud to announce that today we reached another milestone in Cloud Pak for Data journey — today v4.6 is generally available. This is our second feature release in 2022, only 5 months after the release of 4.5. Churning out a high quality feature releases in such short span is no game and this was made possible through the dedication, planning, and hard work of the entire team. \\n Cloud Pak for Data enables organizations to get the most out of their data — encompassing the capabilities of 40+ IBM and partner services that are continually expanding. \\n As our product has matured, our focus has shifted from not only building new features but to also doubling down on what makes us unique in the market — enterprise readiness, robustness and resiliency — making Cloud Pak for Data the best choice for enterprise production workloads. Version 4.6 expands and solidifies upon the capabilities of 4.5, and also introduces some new features and services. As a reminder, this highly anticipated release, as well as all subsequent releases, follows the Cloud Pak for Data lifecycle, which we modeled to fulfill a wide range of customer needs. \\n Below is a summary of what to expect from the Cloud Pak for Data 4.6 platform. \\n Support for NetApp Storage \\n Cloud Pak for Data is now certified to support NetApp ONTAP v22.4.0 or later via Netapp Trident CSI drivers. NetApp’s best-of-breed on-premises and cloud-native data management technologies will ensure robust datastore availability across the board for Cloud Pak for Data workloads. Snapshot-based online backups and restore on same cluster are supported in order to provide uninterrupted operation. \\n Cloud Pak for Data with Spectrum Fusion \\n Cloud Pak for Data is now fully integrated with IBM Spectrum Fusion and IBM Spectrum Fusion HCI, which enables running data and AI workloads including online backups and restore to same or a different clusters. Although Disaster Recovery and Data Protection for Cloud Pak for Data via Spectrum Fusion was introduced in 4.5.3, we made additional improvements in 4.6 making it more reliable and seamless. \\n Compliance Updates \\n In order to keep providing its services to government customers and expand further into federal markets, Cloud Pak for Data has taken the effort to improve &amp; verify its ops on a CIS (Center of Internet Security) hardened Openshift. \\n For the uninitiated, CIS provides benchmark and guideline for set of vendor-agnostic, internationally recognized secure configuration guidelines for various platforms such as Operating systems, Cloud infrastructure, Servers software etc. CIS Kubernetes &amp; OpenShift hardening guidelines are quickly becoming industry standards for containerized workloads and Cloud Pak for Data coming out clean on CIS benchmark is going to be a big deal for our security savvy customers. \\n Monitoring Features \\n In our effort to simplify day 2 operations for Cloud Pak for Data admins, the product will introduce new “Alerts” cards on the homepage which will link to the “Events and alerts” page within Monitoring. This will display critical and warning alerts on the homepage itself. The “Events and alerts” page has also been redesigned to include an interactive bubble graph. These changes were intended to make monitoring more discoverable for administrators. \\n In addition to this, the new “Alert Forwarding” tab in the Configurations page will allow administrators to set up email, SNMP, or Slack notifications to users and can be easily set up with notifications that are pushed to the admin. Our customers have expressed that such configurations were hidden and hence missed. Cards on the main page would help alleviate this problem and provide a better user experience for admins. \\n Finally, admins also have the ability to check the status of their users (online/offline) in Acces</td>\n",

       "      <td>Infuse automation at scale with IBM Cloud Pak for Data 4.0 - When’s the last time you considered if you’re operating in a truly predictive enterprise, furthermore, if it’s easy for your data consumers, models and apps to access the right data? More often than not the answer is a resounding “not very”. Between the proliferation of data types and sources and tightening regulations, data is often held captive, sitting in silos. Traditionally, strategies for overcoming this challenge relied on consolidating the physical data into a single location, structure and vendor. While this strategy seemed great in theory, anyone that has undertaken a migration of this magnitude can tell you it’s easier said than done. \\n Earlier this year at THINK we unveiled our plans for the next generation of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, our alternative to help customers connect the right people to the right data at the right time. Today, I’m excited to share more details on how the latest version of the platform, version 4.0, will bring that vision to life through an intelligent data fabric. \\n Since the launch of IBM Cloud Pak for Data in 2018, our goal has always been to help customers unlock the value of their data and infuse AI throughout their business. Understanding the needs of our clients, we doubled down on delivering a first-of-its-kind containerized platform that provided flexibility to deploy the unique mix of data and AI services a client needs, in the cloud environment of their choice. \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data supports a vibrant ecosystem of proprietary, third party and open source services that we continue to expand on with each release. With version 4.0 we take our efforts to the next level. New capabilities and intelligent automation help business leaders and users tackle the overwhelming data complexity they face to more easily scale the value of their data. \\n A data fabric is an architectural pattern that dynamically orchestrates disparate data sources across a hybrid and multi-cloud landscape to provide business-ready data in support of analytics, AI and applications. The modular and customizable nature of IBM Cloud Pak for Data offers the ideal environment to build a data fabric from best-in-class solutions that is tailored to your unique needs. The tight integration of the microservices within the platform allow for further streamlining of the management and usage of distributed data by infusing intelligent automation. With version 4.0 we’re applying this automation in three key areas: \\n Further augmenting the intelligent automation of our data fabric capabilities is another new service coming to IBM Cloud Pak for Data, IBM Match 360 with Watson. Match 360 provides a machine learning-based, easy to use experience for self-service entity resolution. Non-developers can now match and link data from across their organization, helping to improve overall data quality. \\n IBM SPSS Modeler, IBM Decision Optimization and Hadoop Execution Engine services are also included as part of IBM Cloud Pak for Data 4.0. These capabilities complement the IBM Watson Studio services already within the base and enables users such as business analysts and citizen data scientists, to participate in building AI solutions. \\n AutoAI is enhanced to support relational data sources and generate exportable python code, enabling data scientists to review and update models generated through AutoAI. This is a significant differentiator compared to the AutoML capabilities of competitors, where the generated model is more of a black box. \\n Complementary capabilities are also released on IBM Cloud Pak for Data as a Service, including IBM DataStage and IBM Data Virtualization. Now available fully managed, DataStage helps enable the building of modern data integration pipelines, and the Data Virtualization capability helps to share data across the organization in near real-time, connecting governed data to your AI and ML tools. \\n Finally, IBM Cloud Pak for Data 4.0 includes sev</td>\n",

In projects users can add members to collaborate with, using a range of tools such as Auto AI, analytic flows, data flows, and very importantly Notebooks and Scripts to run their own Python or R code. \\n Notebooks and Scripts are powered by Runtime Environments in which JupyterLab allows to create and run Jupyter Notebooks and Scripts. Runtime environment definitions allow to specify the number of virtual cores, gigabytes of memory, and optionally number of GPUs required to run Notebooks and Scripts in an environment. Users can also specify a software configuration with packages to be loaded on environment startup in addition to packages that are pre-loaded for runtime environments. \\n How do you secure and control the environment for all data scientists in an enterprise? \\n Often, enterprises have a need to ensure that their developers and data scientists use only packages that are approved for use in projects in the enterprise. Also, enterprises may have their own proprietary packages that also need to be made available to data scientists. In order to ensure fast start up times for runtime environments and fast, reliable loading of packages from within Notebooks or Scripts, enterprises often need a caching solution to accelerate package loading to be faster than loading packages from remote origins on the Internet. \\n IBM and Anaconda recently announced a partnership to help enteprises achieve just that. Anaconda Repository with IBM, integrated with IBM Cloud Pak for Data, solves for these needs. As visualized in the picture below, custom runtime environments can be defined to load packages from conda channels served by Anaconda Repository with IBM, to run Notebooks and Scripts using these packages. Alternatively, code in Notebooks or Scripts can load packages via Conda. \\n To ensure that developers and data scientists only use approved packages, customers may block access to packages on the internet from the Cloud Pak for Data environment, forcing that all package loading goes through Anaconda Repository with IBM. Anaconda Repository with IBM caches packages originating from the Internet and allows admins to upload a customer’s own proprietary packages to serve up securely and with consistent performance in addition to the cached open source packages. \\n Getting Cloud Pak for Data to use Anaconda Repository with IBM is easy \\n First, an administrator of the system needs to edit an RC file on the Cloud Pak for Data system to add the Anaconda Repository with IBM service as a server of conda channels, from which Cloud Pak for Data will then know to load packages. \\n Then data scientists and other users working in Cloud Pak for Data projec</td>\n",

It provides the needed tools for data science projects including connectivity to various data sources, governing and organizing data, training and evaluating AI and ML models and finally deploying these models and infuse them into business processes. \\n Many companies have collected huge volumes of data in their data lakes, often implemented using Hadoop. It is required to leverage this data along with other traditional data sources to enable successful data science projects that utilize all enterprise data without barriers. \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data enables many different ways to connect to Hadoop data in a secured and managed way. This includes accessing HDFS files as well as relational data in Hive databases. Under the covers, Cloud Pak for Data can connect to remote Hadoop clusters using various APIs such as WebHDFS, Livy, and JDBC. \\n The Hadoop ecosystem provides numerous different tools and access methods. This enables building a large variety of solutions on top of Hadoop. But the features can also be overwhelming to data analysts and data scientists who are not necessarily familiar with all those tools and APIs. Instead they need simple methods for analyzing the data quickly. \\n Security requirements can represent another hurdle that users need to overcome. Companies often place their Hadoop system behind a firewall and control access using, e.g., Kerberos. \\n These issues are addressed by IBM Cloud Pak for Data and its Hadoop Execution Engine service. This allows users to exploit the breadth of data and the scalability of their large Hadoop systems. \\n Hadoop Execution Engine \\n A key component in the architecture of IBM Cloud Pak for Data working together with Hadoop is the Hadoop Execution Engine. This is add-on service that can be installed separately as part of Cloud Pak for Data offering and enables Hadoop data access and push workload to remote Spark cluster. \\n It gets installed on an edge node of a Hadoop cluster and acts as a safe gateway between a Cloud Pak for Data and Hadoop. It manages security aspects such as Kerberos and allows only Cloud Pak for Data authorized users to access Hadoop data and run jobs on remote Spark cluster. \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data can be connected to multiple Hadoop systems provided that each of them has the Hadoop Execution Engine installed. Similarly, a single gateway can handle connections from multiple Cloud Pak for Data platforms. High availability of the gateway on edge nodes is also supported. \\n Collect Hadoop Data \\n Connections to Hadoop data can be made via Hadoop Execution Engine or natively through direct access to Hadoop endpoints like WebHDFS or through JDBC to Hive. Using Hadoop Execution Engine ensure the connections are managed and secured by Execution Engine gateway with high availability supported. Cloud Pak for Data users can create these connections and use it later within Cloud Pak for Data different services, such as analytics projects, transform projects, data governance,.. etc. \\n Data Virtualization for Hadoop Data \\n The Data virtualization add-on in Cloud Pak for Data enables you to create data sets from disparate data sources so that you can query and use the data as if it came from a single source. Hive data sets are also supported in the data virtualization add-on via the built-in “Hive JDBC” connection type. When Data virtualization is enabled, you can virtualize Hive data sources and start using it by running queries with ability to join Hive tables with other data sources. \\n Organize Hadoop Data \\n IBM Cloud Pak for Data provides functionality to govern big data assets to enable business users, data engineers, and data architects manage these assets wi', 'title': '7'}, 'score': 22.384641647338867}, {'document': {'rank': 1, 'document_id': 'db592bf76789c4b53c56f3405ea16165_64', 'text': ' Migrating Big data Applications from Hadoop to IBM Cloud Pak for Data\\u200a—\\u200aPart\\xa01 Migrating Spark\\xa0Jobs… This series of blogs on migrating big data applications from Hadoop to IBM Cloud Pak for Data are being authored with the collective inputs from the IBM Financial Crimes and Insights (FCI) team based on their experience in migrating the FCI product to IBM Cloud Pak for Data.Special thanks to the reviewers of the series Rachit Arora, Software Architect at IBM Analytics Engine(Cloud Pak for Data) and IBM Watson Studio Spark Environments and Srinivasan Muthuswamy, Senior Technical Staff Member IBM India Software Labs. \\n This article is the first in the series of articles on migrating Big data applications running on Hadoop to IBM Cloud Pak for Data. This first post focuses on migrating Spark jobs from Hadoop to IBM Analytics Engine Powered by Apache Spark on IBM Cloud Pak for Data. \\n There are a number of articles that have been written , providing the storage and compute perspectives of moving away from Hadoop (please see the references section of this post for links to some of them).

       "'Collect, Govern and Analyze Hadoop Data using IBM Cloud Pak forData - Written by Basem Elasioty and Gregor Meyer IBM Cloud Pak for Data is a cloud-native solution that enables data scientists, data engineers and business experts to collaborate defining, developing, validating and deploying analytic products. It provides the needed tools for data science projects including connectivity to various data sources, governing and organizing data, training and evaluating AI and ML models and finally deploying these models and infuse them into business processes. Many companies have collected huge volumes of data in their data lakes, often implemented using Hadoop. It is required to leverage this data along with other traditional data sources to enable successful data science projects that utilize all enterprise data without barriers. IBM Cloud Pak for Data enables many different ways to connect to Hadoop data in a secured and managed way. This includes accessing HDFS files as well as relational data in Hive databases. Under the covers, Cloud Pak for Data can connect to remote Hadoop clusters using various APIs such as WebHDFS, Livy, and JDBC. The Hadoop ecosystem provides numerous different tools and access methods. This enables building a large variety of solutions on top of Hadoop. But the features can also be overwhelming to data analysts and data scientists who are not necessarily familiar with all those tools and APIs. Instead they need simple methods for analyzing the data quickly. Security requirements can represent another hurdle that users need to overcome. Companies often place their Hadoop system behind a firewall and control access using, e.g., Kerberos. These issues are addressed by IBM Cloud Pak for Data and its Hadoop Execution Engine service. This allows users to exploit the breadth of data and the scalability of their large Hadoop systems. Hadoop Execution Engine A key component in the architecture of IBM Cloud Pak for Data working together with Hadoop is the Hadoop Execution Engine. This is add-on service that can be installed separately as part of Cloud Pak for Data offering and enables Hadoop data access and push workload to remote Spark cluster. It gets installed on an edge node of a Hadoop cluster and acts as a safe gateway between a Cloud Pak for Data and Hadoop. It manages security aspects such as Kerberos and allows only Cloud Pak for Data authorized users to access Hadoop data and run jobs on remote Spark cluster. IBM Cloud Pak for Data can be connected to multiple Hadoop systems provided that each of them has the Hadoop Execution Engine installed. Similarly, a single gateway can handle connections from multiple Cloud Pak for Data platforms. High availability of the gateway on edge nodes is also supported. Collect Hadoop Data Connections to Hadoop data can be made via Hadoop Execution Engine or natively through direct access to Hadoop endpoints like WebHDFS or through JDBC to Hive. Using Hadoop Execution Engine ensure the connections are managed and secured by Execution Engine gateway with high availability supported. Cloud Pak for Data users can create these connections and use it later within Cloud Pak for Data different services, such as analytics projects, transform projects, data governance,.. etc. Data Virtualization for Hadoop Data The Data virtualization add-on in Cloud Pak for Data enables you to create data sets from disparate data sources so that you can query and use the data as if it came from a single source. Hive data sets are also supported in the data virtualization add-on via the built-in Hive JDBC connection type. When Data virtualization is enabled, you can virtualize Hive data sources and start using it by running queries with ability to join Hive tables with other data sources.
